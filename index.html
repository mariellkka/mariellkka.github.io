			<p>European leaders have come to a 27-nation consensus that a “hard Brexit” is likely to be the only way to see off future populist insurgencies, which could lead to the break-up of the European Union. Why Europe will drive a hard Brexit? The hardening line in EU capitals comes as Nigel Farage warns European leaders that Marine Le Pen, leader of the Front National, could deliver a political sensation bigger than Brexit and win France’s presidential election next spring – a result that would mean it was “game over” for 60 years of EU integration.

			<p>Philip Hammond urged EU countries to “think very carefully about what they want” before hanging Britain out to dry in any post-Brexit settlement. EU leaders have repeatedly said the UK will not get trade concessions if does not participate in freedom of movement with the bloc – upholding one of its founding pillars. They have also threatened to withhold so-called “passporting” rights for the City– which would pull the rug out from under the UK’s financial sector.
